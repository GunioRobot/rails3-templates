Rails 3 Template

This is an early effort to create a quick and easy way to set up a customized Rails 3 app with whatever gems you might need.

As of right now the generator makes the following assumptions:

1. You have RVM installed;
2. You have Ruby version 1.9.2 installed;
3. You have Rails 3 installed; and
4. You will want to use JQuery as your Javascript library.

Some of this is based on the templates created by Tactivestylus (https://gist.github.com/280196/5c075f4a3d3a4118d1d706fce07e40572a3873c7)
